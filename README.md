- ⚡ Fun fact: Albuquerque, NM is at the same latitude as the islands of Crete and Cyprus, as well as Tehran, Kabul, Busan, Kyoto, and Mt. Fuji.
- 🍑 Did you know: Albuquerque might be named for the apricot, which is albaricoque in Spanish? Stone fruits grow well in our climate, and were grown here both before and after the Pueblo revolt.
- 🌳 However, it might come from Portuguese from the Latin "quercus alba", "white oak", the tree which bears cork bark. Alburquerque is still a center of the Spanish cork industry, and the town coat-of-arms features a white cork oak.
